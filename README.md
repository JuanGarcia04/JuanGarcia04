## 📌 About Me

I am a future engineer with a strong focus on **software project management**, applying the principles of **PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)** as a core guide for planning, execution, monitoring, and control of technology projects.

My professional approach integrates both traditional and agile methodologies such as **Scrum** and **Extreme Programming (XP)**, and I primarily work with an **iterative software life cycle**, ensuring continuous, client-oriented deliverables.

## 💼 Project Experience

### 🔹 Laboratory Reservation System

At Universidad Católica de Pereira, the lab reservation process was manual, leading to scheduling conflicts. I led the structuring of the project by conducting requirement gathering through meetings with key users. I modeled the system using flowcharts and use case diagrams, working under an iterative approach that allowed for validating functionalities at each stage. The implemented system reduced reservation errors, enabled real-time availability checks, and improved space management for academic use, positively impacting students and faculty.

### 🔹 Intelligent Access Control System

The project aims to modernize space management at the Universidad Católica de Pereira through the use of IoT and RFID technologies integrated with web systems, strengthening institutional security, efficiency, and traceability. This solution seeks to transform manual processes into automated, secure, and real-time connected operations, driving the digitalization of the university’s infrastructure.

The solution was developed using Flask, React, and MySQL, ensuring scalability and seamless connectivity between physical devices and the web platform. Initially conceived as a business project, its technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness led to the creation of a university research group to further refine its development and plan its future institutional integration.

Regarding project management, we applied PMBOK best practices for planning and controlling scope, time, cost, and risks, alongside agile methodologies (Scrum and XP) that encouraged collaboration, continuous iteration, and progressive improvement of the prototype. This structured approach ensured technical consistency, on-time delivery, and alignment with the university’s academic and technological quality standards.

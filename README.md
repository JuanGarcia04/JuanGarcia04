## 📌 About Me

I am a future engineer with a strong focus on **software project management**, applying the principles of **PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)** as a core guide for planning, execution, monitoring, and control of technology projects.

My professional approach integrates both traditional and agile methodologies such as **Scrum** and **Extreme Programming (XP)**, and I primarily work with an **iterative software life cycle**, ensuring continuous, client-oriented deliverables.

## 💼 Project Experience

### 🔹 Laboratory Reservation System

At Universidad Católica de Pereira, the lab reservation process was manual, leading to scheduling conflicts. I led the structuring of the project by conducting requirement gathering through meetings with key users. I modeled the system using flowcharts and use case diagrams, working under an iterative approach that allowed for validating functionalities at each stage. The implemented system reduced reservation errors, enabled real-time availability checks, and improved space management for academic use, positively impacting students and faculty.

### 🔹 Intelligent Access Control System

This project aimed to manage access to restricted areas through a smart access system, enhancing institutional security. I designed interactive mockups using **Figma**, focusing on user experience. The project was structured following PMBOK best practices, applying estimation techniques for cost, time, and risk analysis. Using **Scrum** and **XP** principles, we developed iterative deliverables that allowed for continuous feedback and improvement. The final prototype accurately represented the system’s functional flow and was praised for its structured and technically sound project management.
